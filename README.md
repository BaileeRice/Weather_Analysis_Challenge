# World_Weather_Analysis

## OVERVIEW

Creating a travel app that does weather analysis of over 600 cities worldwide. Then implementing input statements to filter the data for their weather preferences, which will be used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels.

## STEPS

1: Retrieve Weather Data

Generate a set of 2,000 random latitudes and longitudes, retrieve the nearest city, and perform an API call with OpenWeatherMap. In addition to the city weather data, use your API skills to retrieve the current weather description for each city. Then, create a new DataFrame containing the updated weather data

2: Create a Customer Travel Destinations Map

Employ input statements to retrieve customer weather preferences. Next, use those preferences to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. Finally, showing those destinations on a marker layer map with pop-up markers.

3: Create a Travel Itinerary Map

Use the Google Directions API to create a travel itinerary that shows the route between four cities chosen from the customerâ€™s possible travel destinations. Then, creating a marker layer map with a pop-up marker for each city on the itinerary.
